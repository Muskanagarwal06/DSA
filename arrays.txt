STATIC AND DYNAMIC ARRAYS

    STATIC ARRAYS refers to arrays that have a fixed size and cannot be resized after they are created.
    and the elements are indexable from range[0,size-1]...
    
    indexable means that we can access the elements of the array using their index...
    use of static arrays:
    1. when the size of the array is known at compile time and does not change during the program execution
    2. when the array is small and does not require dynamic memory allocation
    3. when the array is used for simple data structures like stacks, queues, and linked lists
    4. when the array is used for simple algorithms like sorting and searching
    5. when the array is used for simple data structures like trees and graphs
    
    now lets talk about complexity analysis of static arrays:
    there can only be two types of algorithms that can be applied on static arrays:
    1. Access :
        accessing an element in a static array by index takes O(1) time complexity
        because we can directly access the element at a specific index without iterating through the array
        for example:
        int arr[5] = {1,2,3,4,5};
        int x = arr[2]; // accessing the element at index 2
        here it takes the same amount of time to access the element at index 2 regardless of the size of the array

        0(1) means constant time complexity

    2.search :
        searching for an element in a static array takes O(n) time complexity
        because we have to check each element one by one until we find the element we are looking for
        more the elements in the array, more time it will take to find the element
        so the time taken grows linearly with the size of the input
        for example:
        int arr[5] = {1,2,3,4,5};
        int x = 3;
        for(int i=0; i<5; i++) {
            if(arr[i] == x) {
                // found the element
            }
        }
        here we have to check each element one by one until we find the element we are looking for
        so the time taken grows linearly with the size of the input

    DYNAMIC ARRAYS refers to arrays that can be resized during the program execution .
    and the elements are indexable from range[0,size-1]...
