>> STL: STL stands for Standard Template Library in C++. 
   It is a powerful set of C++ template classes that provides common data structures and algorithms, saving time and effort when writing code.
   Common data structures like Vector, Queue , Stack, Set.\

Vector is array like data structure but dynamic in nature.
Dynamic here means vector do not have fixed size it's size can be changed.
#include<vector>     ( in header files.)

Vector Syntax:

vector<int> vec;     (size=0)
or
vector<int> vec={1,2,3}   (size=3)
or
vector<int> vect(5,7)        (size=5 and value at every index is 7)

Can iterate through vector using for-each loop
Syntax:
for(int val: vect){
    cout<<val<<" ";
}
output: 7 7 7 7 7 

Vector Functions:              //Usecase of all these is shown in vector.cpp file

1) size
Returns the size of the vector.
eg.
vector<int> vec={1,2,3}
cout<<vec.size();            //output: 3

2) push_back
Adds an element to the end of the vector and increases its size by 1.

3) pop_back
Deletes an element from the end of vector and decreases its size by 1.

4) front
Returns value at first index of vector.

5) back
Returns value at last index of vector.

6) at
This is  similar to accessing a value at particular index.
vect[0] and vect.at(0) both will give the same outputs.
